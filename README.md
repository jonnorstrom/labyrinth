# labyrinth
A rails/ajax-ified version of the Labyrinth challenge.

This was a self-excercise to further familiarize and utilize different frameworks together.
Live site can be found at [mazerunner](https://mazerunner.herokuapp.com).

To Use:

1. Start clicking anywhere on the 'game board'. Click a box more than once to start going through the carousel of options.
2. Once you have made your maze, click "LET'S DO THIS" and watch the little mazerunner find his way through.

*Disclaimer*

As this was a weekend-project - it happens to not have much of a UX/UI aspect.
Any unsolvable maze will result in a stale mazerunner once he's exhausted all of his options.
You must refresh the page before trying to make a new maze.
